# Nutrello
## We’ll take care of your Nutrition and Fitness

### Submission to HackHealth Hackathon 2018 by WiCS at Stony Brook University

## What we are doing?
Nutrello is your partner in good health. It will help you make the right choice about what you eat.

- Just take a picture of your food and leave it to us.
- We’ll automatically detect what your eating (using vision API) and give you the nutrient breakup of your food (using US Agriculture department API).
- That’s not all, after we help you make an informed choice about what your eating, we will observe your eating habits for a day or two, and then recommend you a nutrition and fitness plan according to your fitness goal and information.

## Next Steps
- The last feature of fitness plan recommendation is yet to be implemented.
- Nutrello can also be extended as a mobile application, that can be used directly with the mobile camera.

## How to use?
- Go to the project link, register with basic information.
- Upload the photo of your meal [demo folder has sample images].
- We will detect your food and give you a nutrient breakup.
- Use again!
- Nutrello can recommend fitness plans in the future.
